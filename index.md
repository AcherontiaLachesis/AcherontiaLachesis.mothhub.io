<h1> Welcome to the Moth Hub </h1>
<h2> Season's Greetings </h2>
<p> You might be thinking "What is this website" or "Why is it named 'The Moth Hub'". Fret not! I have answers to these questions in the obligatory and contractually required FAQ section! </p>
<h2> FAQ </h2>
<h4> Why is it named <em> The Moth Hub </em> </h4>
<p> I'm running low on ideas that's why. Do you think I would've chosen the name <em> The Moth Hub </em> if I had any better names? </p>
<h4> Why moths? </h4>
<p> The <em> <strong> WHOLE BRAND NAME </em> </strong> is based on a moth species name! (Acherontia Lachesis is the Greater Death's Head Hawkmoth.) </p>
<h4> Honestly seems like a <em> 5head </em> moment. <em> KEKW </em> get owned </h4>
<p> what does that even mean?????? </p>
