<h2> FAQ </h2>

<h4> Why is it named <em> The Moth Hub </em> </h4>
<p> It sprouts from the name <em> Acherontia Lachesis </em>, since it is the name of a moth species. Put one to one together and you get the Moth Hub! </p>

<h4> Why moths? </h4>
<p> Aside from moths being one of the best insect species, they also played a huge role in the naming of my brand and even the song titles early on! Otherwise, it's both due to a fascination about moths and the novelty of it. Have you seen any other musicians base their career's brand on both moths and their own (pixel) art?  </p>

<h4> What do you use to make music? Would you recommend this field to others? </h4>
<p> 100%! Music has been an extremely cathartic thing for me, both allowing me to blow off steam and express myself creatively! Making music requires dedication and patience, it's one of those fields where if you really put your mind to it, you can get some impressive things done. <br>
  To answer the other part of the question, I use bandlab and audacity. </p>
  
<h4> Have you thought of putting your music on other services than Soundcloud and Youtube?</h4>
<p>Yes! I've though about putting it on Spotify multiple times, but it actually costs money to put your music on to Spotify, which kinda turned me off when it came to the idea of putting it on Spotify.</p>

<h4> Honestly seems like a <em> 5head </em> moment. <em> KEKW </em> get owned </h4>
<p> what does that even mean?????? </p>
