<h2> Music Plans </h2>
<p> I want to preface this by mentioning two other pieces of work. Both are from Ace Combat 5 and both deal with massive submarines carrying WMDs. The songs <em> Hrimfaxi </em> and <em> Scinfaxi </em> are somewhat massive inspirations for the next song I'll be making. </p>

<p> Nextly, I really need to talk about Firestorm's video. I honestly hate that I probably let down some people with me not being able to release it, especially since I <em> <strong> kinda lost the file after I had to wipe my computer's data </strong> </em>. The art for the video is lost to the sands of time, but it serves me right for messing with partition tables without understanding it properly.</p>

<p> I really shouldn't be teasing the next song, which was mentioned in the first part, but I'll probably have the promotional art and maybe even a promotional animation done sooner or later. I also have to come up with a name, which'll probably take either a massive amount of time or be made in a split second. </p>
