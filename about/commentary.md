<h2> Commentary </h2>
<p> Starting off simple with Sacrosanct's video, I had the idea for it floating around in my head for a while. Easily one of my favorite tracks I made and I was extremely happy with the video for it. It was the first full-on music video I did too. The song's title and art were inspired by SCP-3000, which is a good read already. </p>
