<h3>Sacrosanct</h3>

<p> Starting off simple with Sacrosanct's video, I had the idea for it floating around in my head for a while. Easily one of my favorite tracks I made and I was extremely happy with the video for it. It was the first full-on music video I did too. The song's title and art were inspired by SCP-5001, which is a good read already. </p>

<h3>Apotheosis</h3>

<p>This one's art is probably one of the most drastic changes I have made to designs. It went from a giant mechanical hand with lightning sprouting down from the fingers into pyramids and lasers. </p>

<p>The gain mechanical hand idea never truly came to fruition though. Whilst an incredibly unique design, it provided both too much complexity for the pixel art's size and hard animation. The scenery in it didn't work and also helped in the scrapping of the idea. All I really have left of the proposed design is the unfinished art for it and the sketches in my sketch book. <br>
  If you have seen the video for Apotheosis, you have noticed that there is something far different than the scrapped designs. Namely, it is the pyramids and the giant red laser. This idea was spur of the moment, and honestly it worked out spectacularly, both providing a good piece for the video and some pretty good comments. </p>

<h3> Eclipse </h3>

<p> Honestly one of the most draining videos I've made, ultimately I wasn't that much a fan of both the song and art. If I recall correctly, I've labelled it one of my most experimental tracks, and that is right. Hell, even the video itself was experimental, with it using 5 seperate "phases" for the art, mostly to provide a more dynamic video (and to boost the viewer retention). Eclipse itself might've not been my proudest work, but the stuff I learnt from it has been incredibly valueable. </p>

<h3>Firestorm</h3>

<p>Whilst I can't really give any commentary on the making of the video for the song due to both the video not being released and how the assets for the video are <strong> gone </strong>, I can tell you about the process of making the song (and blatantly plagarize myself). The start of the song uses a similar tactic that both Sacrosanct and Breach used, which is more of an introductory piece that transitions to the main song, though I did the transition in a style that I did in Breach. I didn't truly use the bait-and-switch I did in Breach, favoring to have an introduction that actually sounded like the main song. Skipping forward into the song, there is a section that I reworked multiple times, mostly messing around with distorted guitars and the such to try to get a good sounding section. Originally I wanted the section to more heavily use the distorted guitars, but I decided against it. Skipping even further on into the song, there is a section where it transitions into a section that is a heavy callback to Abyssal Warfare, albeit using multiple EAS warnings and with audio panning to make them sound more like a broken radio or if the signals were fighting. This section transfers into my favorite part, the finale. I made the guitars, drums, and even the EAS warning samples glitch out for the final section, as if to say the fire has finally broken the devices and this is its final communication. <br>
  Firestorm feels closer to a return to my roots and then some, and that is 100% correct. I am extremely proud of the track and I think it came out spectacularly.  </p>
